  <p>
    I remember the day when the first case of COVID-19 in INDIA was announced on the news. It was truly shocking. The
    Government of India had instructed to stay home for safety and protection from the COVID-19. This period added two
    new words in my dictionary (which I was completely unaware of) `LOCKDOWN` and `SOCIAL DISTANCING`. Later on in the
    lockdown I got to know the real meaning of these words from my parents. I was very disappointed. I had no idea what
    I was going to do the whole lockdown. I couldn't play with friends or go outside for swimming and cycling. The next
    day my father gave me an idea about what to do while sitting at home. He said that the lockdown was going to be for
    a month or two, or even more. So, in that time, I could learn computer programming!.
  </p>
  <p>
    My father had been pushing me to learn computer programming even before the lockdown, but I wouldn't budge anytime
    he gave a lesson on programming. I came to know that one of my favorite games was designed with the <a
      href="https://unity.com">Unity</a> Game Engine, which uses C# for programming. I was kind of fascinated you could
    actually <b>MAKE</b> games (...I was only 12). I started learning to make games with Unity. At first, I was a little
    intimidated by the interface, but soon I got hold of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a daily practice of 4 hours, I became a master (not so much) in Unity. I was quite happy with all the games I
    made. Later I started learning C and C++ which are one of the greatest programming languages, created by Dennis
    Richie and Bjarne Stroustrup respectively. It was quite easy and soon I mastered basic and intermediate C# too. Last
    but not the least, I also learned Python and Java.

    My biggest achievements in the lockdown period are the games I designed:<br>

    What I learned from the lockdown:- Never expect anyone to give you what you want. Work hard, show some dedication
    and go get it yourself.
