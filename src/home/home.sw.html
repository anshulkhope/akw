        C++ is my most favourite language. C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by
        Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". ... The C++ programming
        language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11
        and C++14 standards.

        Java is a widely used programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed environment of the
        internet. ... Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be
        distributed among servers and clients in a network.

        C# is a hybrid of C and C++, it is a Microsoft programming language developed to compete with Sun's Java
        language. C# is an object-oriented programming language used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform
        and designed for improving productivity in the development of Web applications. I am specifically using c# for
        making games with Unity Game Engine.
